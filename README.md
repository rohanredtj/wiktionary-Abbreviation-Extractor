# Wiktionary Data Processor

A sophisticated tool designed to extract and analyze abbreviations and linguistic data from Wiktionary XML dumps. This project demonstrates advanced skills in parsing complex data structures, implementing custom algorithms for text analysis, and handling various edge cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of linguistic variations.

## Features

- Parse large Wiktionary XML dump files efficiently
- Extract parts of speech (POS) information
- Identify and extract abbreviations, initialisms, and acronyms
- Handle complex linguistic variations and edge cases
- Generate structured output in CSV format for further analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- xml.etree.ElementTree for XML parsing
- Regular expressions for text processing
- Typer for creating command-line interfaces
- CSV module for data output

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Wiktionary Data Processor on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohanredtj/wiktionary-abbreviation-extractor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wiktionary-data-processor
   ```

3. Install required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your Wiktionary XML dump file. You can download the latest dump from the [Wiktionary dumps page](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/).

2. Run the processor with the following command:

   ```bash
   python wiktionary_processor.py <input_file> <output_file>
   ```

   Replace `<input_file>` with the path to your Wiktionary XML dump file, and `<output_file>` with the desired path for the output CSV file.

3. The script will process the dump file and generate a CSV output containing words, their parts of speech, and any identified abbreviations.

## Code Structure

The main components of the Wiktionary Data Processor are:

- `extract_abbreviations()`: Extracts abbreviations using predefined patterns
- `pos_and_map()`: Identifies parts of speech in the input text
- `process_wiktionary_dump()`: Main function for processing the XML dump
- `write_csv()`: Writes extracted data to a CSV file

## Example Output

The generated CSV file will have the following structure:

```
word,pos,abbreviations
example,noun|verb,ex|eg
abbreviation,noun,abbr
```

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Large File Handling**: Implemented memory-efficient XML parsing using `iterparse` to handle gigabyte-sized dump files.
- **Complex Text Processing**: Developed sophisticated regex patterns to accurately extract abbreviations and linguistic information.
- **Edge Cases**: Implemented robust error handling and validation to manage various linguistic edge cases and ensure data integrity.
